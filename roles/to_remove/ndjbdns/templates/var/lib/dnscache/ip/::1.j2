#
# A file in this directory, named after an IP or a subnet address tells
# dnscached daemon to accept DNS requests from the said IP/subnet address.
#
# For ex:
#
#   File name : Action
# ===========================================================================
#
#   ::1 : tells dnscached to accept DNS request coming from ::1.
#

#   All DNS requests coming from any other IP addresses are not served by
#   default.
