# Galaxie-Clans Documentation

## How is the documentation organized ?

* [Tutorials](TUTORIAL.md) take you by the hand through a series of steps to setup a clan server. **Start here** if youâ€™re new to Galaxie-Clans.
* [Topic Guides](TOPIC.md) discuss key topics and concepts at a fairly high level and provide useful **background information and explanation**.
* [Reference Guides](REFERENCE.md) contain technical reference on aspects of Galaxie-Clans' machinery. They describe **how it works and how to use it** but assume that you have a basic understanding of key concepts.
* [How-To Guides](HOW-TO.md) are cooking recipes. They guide you through the steps involved in addressing **key problems and specific use-cases**. They are more advanced than tutorials and assume some knowledge of how Galaxie-Clans works.

## Why is it so ?

This structure is borrowed from Daniele Procida's presentation at PyCon Australia: "What nobody tells you about documentation".

Thanks to him.
